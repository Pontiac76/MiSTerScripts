# kickmount.sh
## About
This script re-logs onto your CIFS mount.
This script does not handle authentication to your CIFS
I run this out of the /root directory when needed.

## Requirements
This script relies on the script from the MiSTer-devel scripts.
https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/CIFS_MiSTer

## License
This script is 100% "Do whatever you want with it".  I can't be bothered to "pick" a license, so, public domain, MIT, whatever the most open license there is.  If it's no license, that's the one I want!
