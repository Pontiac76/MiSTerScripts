# kickmount.sh
## About
This script re-logs onto your CIFS mount.
This script does not handle authentication to your CIFS
I run this out of the /root directory when needed.

## Requirements
This script relies on the script from the MiSTer-devel scripts.
https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/CIFS_MiSTer

## Recommendations
It is HIGHLY recommended to run on your Local Area Network via a hard-wired setup, and not over WiFi, and not over the Internet via a VPN.

That isn't to say you can't use WiFi or the Internet, but they're not as stable connections as a wire.

## License
This is Public Domain, MIT, whatever.  I'll never take someone to court over when the documentation is longer than the BASH script. ;)  If you use it, let me know, I'd like to hear about it, but it's ABSOLUTELY not a requirement!

## How to use
Please see the Wiki.
